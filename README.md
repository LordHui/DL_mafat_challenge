This project is the LedZep Team's solution to the MAFAT Challenge presented by the Israeli Department of Defense. 

The files and notebooks in this repository were developed and executed in Google Colaboratory. In the case that you wish to run and train MNNet, it would be optimal to upload the files to Google Drive. Additionally, the full MAFAT dataset iS upwards of 10GB and is not able to be presented in this repository. Therefore, a link to the Google Drive Folder for the MAFAT data follows. 

To use each file...

-- data_exploration.ipynb file allows for the visualization of data labels and properties. 

-- train_space.ipynb file is where all training takes place. Appropriate alterations have to be made to ensure that the training will work properly in your directory. The train_space.ipynb file requires support functions that are provided in support_files.py, network_support.py, and train.py. 

-- cdcgan.py file is where the GAN used to generate fake images is located.
